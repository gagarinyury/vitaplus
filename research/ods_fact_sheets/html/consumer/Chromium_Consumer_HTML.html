</nav><h2 id="h1">What is chromium and what does it do?</h2>

<p>Chromium is a mineral found in many foods. Researchers do not fully understand what chromium does in your body, but it might help you use carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.</p>

<p>There are two main forms of chromium. This fact sheet is about chromium (III), the type of chromium found in foods and some dietary supplements. A different type of chromium, called chromium (VI) (sometimes called hexavalent chromium) is a poisonous byproduct of industrial manufacturing.</p>

<h2 id="h2">How much chromium do I need?</h2>

<p>Scientists do not currently think that chromium is necessary for good health, and chromium deficiency has not been reported in healthy people. However, in 2001 scientists did consider chromium to be an essential nutrient, and they set recommended amounts based on the evidence available at that time. Here are the average daily recommended amounts in micrograms (mcg) that were established in 2001:</p>

<h2 id="h3">What foods provide chromium?</h2>

<p>Many foods contain chromium. The amount of chromium in fruits and vegetables depends on the amount of chromium in the soil and water in which they were grown. The amount in meat depends on the animal&rsquo;s diet. Using stainless steel equipment to process or cook foods can increase the chromium content of food because small amounts of chromium transfer to the food.</p>

<p>You can get recommended amounts of chromium by eating a variety of foods, including the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Meats, such as ham, beef, and turkey</li>
	<li>Bread and other grain products</li>
	<li>Vegetables, such as lettuce and green beans</li>
	<li>Fruit, such as apples and bananas</li>
	<li>Juices, such as grape, orange, and tomato juices</li>
	<li>Brewer&rsquo;s yeast and nuts</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h4">What kinds of chromium dietary supplements are available?</h2>

<p>Chromium is available in many dietary supplements, such as multivitamin/mineral supplements and supplements that contain only chromium. Chromium in dietary supplements is in many forms, including chromium picolinate and chromium chloride. Your body absorbs chromium similarly from the different forms used in supplements.</p>

<h2 id="h5">What are some effects of chromium supplements on health?</h2>

<p>Scientists are studying chromium supplements to understand whether they affect health. Here are some examples of what this research has shown.</p>

<h3>High blood sugar levels and diabetes</h3>

<p>Chromium supplements are often promoted to improve blood sugar control in people with type 2 diabetes. However, studies examining the effects of chromium on high blood sugar levels or diabetes have had mixed results. The American Diabetes Association does not recommend chromium supplements for people with diabetes because these supplements don't have a clear benefit. More research is needed to understand whether chromium supplements might improve blood sugar control in some people.</p>

<h3>Metabolic syndrome</h3>

<p>Metabolic syndrome&mdash;the combination of excess belly fat, high levels of fat in the blood, high blood sugar, high blood pressure, and low levels of HDL (good) cholesterol&mdash;raises the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and stroke. A few clinical trials have studied the effect of chromium supplements on metabolic syndrome. These studies did not show a benefit of chromium supplementation in people with metabolic syndrome.</p>

<h3>Polycystic ovary syndrome</h3>

<p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a hormonal disorder that affects females of reproductive age. Symptoms include irregular periods, infertility, excess hair on the face or body, acne, and weight gain. PCOS raises the risk of diabetes and heart disease. Studies examining the effects of chromium supplements on PCOS have had mixed results. Any potential benefits appear to be very small. More research is needed to understand whether taking chromium might help lower the risk of PCOS or improve symptoms.</p>

<h3>High cholesterol levels</h3>

<p>High levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol can raise your risk of heart attack and stroke. Studies have examined whether chromium supplements improve cholesterol levels. The results of these studies have been mixed. More research is needed to understand whether chromium supplements have any effect on cholesterol levels.</p>

<h3>Weight and lean body mass</h3>

<p>Some chromium supplements are marketed for weight loss and to reduce body fat and increase muscle mass. However, clinical trials have found only a very small benefit. This benefit is unlikely to make any difference in health or appearance.</p>

<h2 id="h11">Can chromium be harmful?</h2>

<p>Chromium from food and dietary supplements does not appear to cause any harm, but research is limited. People with kidney disease or liver disease should be cautious about taking high amounts of chromium.</p>

<h2 id="h12">Does chromium interact with medications or other dietary supplements?</h2>

<p>Yes. Chromium supplements might interact or interfere with medicines that you take. Here are a few examples:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Insulin. Taking chromium together with insulin might cause low blood sugar levels.</li>
	<li>Metformin and other antidiabetes medications. If you take antidiabetes medicine, taking chromium dietary supplements might cause low blood sugar levels.</li>
	<li>Levothyroxine. Levothyroxine is a medication used to treat hypothyroidism (a condition in which the thyroid gland does not make enough thyroid hormone). Taking chromium dietary supplements together with levothyroxine might reduce the amount of levothyroxine your body absorbs so you might not be getting the full effect of the medication.</li>
</ul>

<p>Tell your doctor, pharmacist, and other health care providers about any dietary supplements and prescription or over-the-counter medicines you take. They can tell you if these dietary supplements might interact with your medicines. They can also explain whether the medicines you take might interfere with how your body absorbs or uses chromium or other nutrients.</p>


<h2 id="h13">Healthful eating</h2>

<p>People should get most of their nutrients from food and beverages, according to the federal government&rsquo;s <em>Dietary Guidelines for Americans.</em> Foods contain vitamins, minerals, dietary fiber, and other components that benefit health. In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible to meet needs for one or more nutrients (for example, during specific life stages such as pregnancy). For more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, see the <a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov" target="_blank"><em>Dietary Guidelines for Americans</em></a> and the U.S. Department of Agriculture&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.myplate.gov" target="_blank">MyPlate.</a></p>

Also called a clinical study. </dd>
			
				<dt>control</dt>
				<dd>In a clinical trial, the group of participants that does not receive the new treatment being studied. This group is compared with the group receiving the new treatment, to see whether the new treatment works. In an observational study, the controls are participants who do not have a particular health condition; the control group is compared with the group of participants who do have the condition to see if certain factors (such as diet, activity level, or use of dietary supplements) may be associated with developing or preventing the condition.</dd>

The first number (the systolic pressure) measures the pressure when the heart beats and pumps out blood into the arteries. The second number (the diastolic pressure) measures the pressure when the heart is at rest between beats. High blood pressure is a condition that occurs when a person's blood pressure often measures above 140/90 or regularly stays at that level or higher. This condition usually has no symptoms but can be life-threatening. It damages the arteries and increases the chance of stroke, heart attack, kidney failure, and blindness. Also called hypertension.</dd>
