<h2 id="h3">What foods provide selenium?</h2>

<p>Selenium is found naturally in many foods. The amount of selenium in plant foods depends on the amount of selenium in the soil where they were grown. The amount of selenium in animal products depends on the selenium content of the foods that the animals ate. You can get recommended amounts of selenium by eating a variety of foods, including the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Seafood</li>
	<li>Meat, poultry, eggs, and dairy products</li>
	<li>Breads, cereals, and other grain products</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h4">What kinds of selenium dietary supplements are available?</h2>

<p>Selenium is available in many multivitamin/mineral supplements and other dietary supplements. It can be present in several different forms, including selenomethionine and sodium selenate.</p>

<h2 id="h5">Am I getting enough selenium?</h2>

<p>Most Americans get enough selenium from their diet because they eat food grown or raised in many different areas, including areas with soil that is rich in selenium.</p>

<p>Certain groups of people are more likely than others to have trouble getting enough selenium:</p>

<ul>
	<li>People undergoing kidney dialysis</li>
	<li>People living with HIV</li>
	<li>People who eat only local foods grown in soils that are low in selenium</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h6">What happens if I don't get enough selenium?</h2>

<p>Selenium deficiency is very rare in the United States and Canada. Selenium deficiency can cause Keshan disease (a type of heart disease) and male infertility. It might also cause Kashin-Beck disease, a type of arthritis that produces pain, swelling, and loss of motion in your joints.</p>

<h2 id="h7">What are some effects of selenium on health?</h2>

<p>Scientists are studying selenium to understand how it affects health. Here are some examples of what this research has shown.</p>

<h3>Cancer</h3>

<p>Studies suggest that people who consume lower amounts of selenium could have an increased risk of developing cancers of the colon and rectum, prostate, lung, bladder, skin, esophagus, and stomach. However, whether selenium supplements reduce cancer risk is not clear. More research is needed to understand the effects of selenium from food and dietary supplements on cancer risk.</p>

<h3>Cardiovascular disease</h3>

<p>Scientists are studying whether selenium helps reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Some studies show that people with lower blood levels of selenium have a higher risk of heart disease, but other studies do not. More studies are needed to better understand how selenium in food and dietary supplements affects heart health.</p>

<h3>Cognitive decline</h3>

<p>Blood selenium levels decrease as people age, and scientists are studying whether low selenium levels contribute to a decline in brain function in older adults. Some studies suggest that people with lower blood selenium levels are more likely to have poorer mental function, but a study of older adults in the United States found no link between selenium levels and memory. More research is needed to find out whether selenium dietary supplements might help reduce the risk of or treat cognitive decline in older adults.</p>

<h3>Thyroid disease</h3>

<p>The thyroid gland has high amounts of selenium that play an important role in thyroid function. Studies suggest that people&mdash;especially women&mdash;who have low blood levels of selenium (and iodine) might develop problems with their thyroid. However, whether selenium dietary supplements can help treat or reduce the risk of thyroid disease is not clear. More research is needed to understand the effects of selenium on thyroid disease.</p>

<h2 id="h12">Can selenium be harmful?</h2>

<p>Yes, if you get too much. Brazil nuts, for example, contain very high amounts of selenium (68&ndash;91 mcg per nut) and can cause you to go over the upper limit if you eat too many. Getting too much selenium over time can cause the following:</p>
<style type="text/css">ul.twocolumnlist {
		width: 600px;
		overflow: hidden;
	}
	ul.twocolumnlist li {
		float: left;
		width: 50%;
	}
</style>
<ul class="twocolumnlist">
	<li>Garlic breath</li>
	<li>Nausea</li>
	<li>Diarrhea</li>
	<li>Skin rashes</li>
	<li>Irritability</li>
	<li>Metallic taste in the mouth</li>
	<li>Brittle hair or nails</li>
	<li>Loss of hair or nails</li>
	<li>Discolored teeth</li>
	<li>Nervous system problems</li>
</ul>

<p>Extremely high intakes of selenium can cause severe problems, including difficulty breathing, tremors, kidney failure, heart attacks, and heart failure.</p>

<p>The daily upper limits for selenium include intakes from all sources&mdash;food, beverages, and supplements&mdash;and are listed below.</p>

<h2 id="h13">Does selenium interact with medications or other dietary supplements?</h2>

<p>Yes, some of the medications you take may interact with selenium. For example, cisplatin, a chemotherapy drug used to treat cancer, can lower selenium levels, but the effect this has on the body is not clear.</p>

<p>Tell your doctor, pharmacist, and other health care providers about any dietary supplements and prescription or over-the-counter medicines you take. They can tell you if the dietary supplements might interact with your medicines or if the medicines might interfere with how your body absorbs, uses, or breaks down nutrients.</p>


<h2 id="h14">Selenium and healthful eating</h2>

<p>People should get most of their nutrients from food and beverages, according to the federal government&rsquo;s <em>Dietary Guidelines for Americans.</em> Foods contain vitamins, minerals, dietary fiber, and other components that benefit health. In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible to meet needs for one or more nutrients (for example, during specific life stages such as pregnancy). For more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, see the <a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov" target="_blank"><em>Dietary Guidelines for Americans</em></a> and the U.S. Department of Agriculture&rsquo;s (USDA's)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.myplate.gov" target="_blank">MyPlate.</a></p>

				<dd>In nutrition, the process of moving protein, carbohydrates, fats, and other nutrients from the digestive system into the bloodstream. Most absorption occurs in the small intestine.</dd>
			
				<dt>arthritis</dt>
				<dd>A group of diseases in which one or more joints (places in the body where two bones connect) become swollen and painful. The most common type of arthritis is osteoarthritis. It is caused by the breakdown of cartilage, a type of tissue that cushions and supports the joint. Without cartilage, the bones in the joint rub together, causing inflammation (swelling, redness, pain, and warmth) and stiffness. Arthritis may affect the fingers, hips, knees, lower back, feet, or any joint in the body.</dd>
			
				<dt>cancer</dt>
				<dd>A group of diseases in which cells divide abnormally and without control, and spread to nearby tissues and other parts of the body. Without treatment, cancer can stop organs from working normally, damage body systems, and cause the patient to die. Cancer may be caused by multiple factors, such as radiation, sunlight, tobacco, certain viruses, and poisonous chemicals; however, the cause of many cancers is unknown.</dd>
			
				<dt>cardiovascular disease</dt>
				<dd>CVD. A general term referring to disorders of the heart and blood vessels. CVD includes coronary artery disease, heart failure, atherosclerosis, high blood pressure, peripheral artery disease, and stroke.</dd>
			
				<dt>chemotherapy</dt>
				<dd>A chemical that kills bacteria, viruses, fungi, or tumor cells. It usually refers to drugs used in cancer treatment.</dd>
			
				<dt>colon</dt>
				<dd>A tube-like organ about 5 feet long in adults that is connected to the small intestine at one end and the anus at the other. The colon absorbs water, some nutrients, and electrolytes (such as sodium and chloride) from partially digested food. The remaining material (solid waste called stool) moves through the colon to the rectum and leaves the body through the anus as a bowel movement. The colon is part of the digestive system (a series of organs from the mouth to the anus). Also called the large intestine.</dd>

				<dd>DNA. The molecules inside cells that carry genetic information and pass it from one generation to the next.</dd>
			
				<dt>dialysis</dt>
				<dd>The process of filtering the blood when the kidneys are not able to cleanse it.</dd>
			
				<dt>diarrhea</dt>
				<dd>Loose, watery stools.</dd>
			
				<dt>dietary fiber</dt>

Good sources of dietary fiber include whole grains (such as brown rice, oats, quinoa, bulgur, and popcorn), legumes (such as black beans, garbanzo beans, split peas, and lentils), nuts, seeds, fruit, and vegetables.</dd>
			
				<dt>Dietary Guidelines for Americans</dt>
				<dd>Advice from the federal government to promote health and reduce the chance (risk) of long-lasting (chronic) diseases through nutrition and physical activity. The Guidelines are updated and published every 5 years by the US Department of Health and Human Services and the US Department of Agriculture.</dd>
			
				<dt>dietary supplement</dt>
				<dd>A product that is intended to supplement the diet. A dietary supplement contains one or more dietary ingredients (including vitamins, minerals, herbs or other botanicals, amino acids, and other substances) or their components; is intended to be taken by mouth as a pill, capsule, tablet, or liquid; and is identified on the front label of the product as being a dietary supplement. </dd>
			
				<dt>drug</dt>
				<dd>Any substance (other than food) that is used to prevent, diagnose, treat, or relieve symptoms of a disease or abnormal condition. Also, a substance that alters mood or body function or that can be habit-forming or addictive, especially a narcotic.</dd>

				<dd>The muscular tube through which food passes from the throat to the stomach.</dd>
			
				<dt>fortified</dt>
				<dd>When nutrients (such as vitamins and minerals) are added to a food product. For example, when calcium is added to orange juice, the orange juice is said to be "fortified with calcium". Similarly, many breakfast cereals are "fortified" with several vitamins and minerals.</dd>
			
				<dt>free radical</dt>
				<dd>An atom or molecule made in the body that can damage cells. A free radical has at least one unpaired electron, which makes it unstable. To become stable, the free radical takes an electron away from another atom, which makes <em>that</em> atom unstable, and starts a chain reaction that can injure cells. Free radicals are made during chemical changes that take place in a cell or an organism to produce energy and basic materials needed for important life processes (metabolism). They also come from tobacco smoke, pollution, radiation from the sun and x-rays, and other sources outside the body. Free radicals damage cells, cause genetic alterations (mutations), and may play a role in cancer, heart disease, and age-related diseases (such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Lou Gehrig's diseases). Free radicals are also beneficial; they are involved in killing germs (microorganisms) and they help hormones and chemical messengers communicate with cells. Proteins (enzymes) made by the body, and vitamin C, vitamin E, and beta carotene in the diet help prevent free radical damage.</dd>

				<dt>iodine</dt>
				<dd>A mineral the body needs to make thyroid hormones, which control metabolism (the process of turning the food you eat into energy your body can use) and many other essential functions, including bone and brain development during pregnancy and infancy. Iodine is found in seaweed, seafood, dairy products, grain products, eggs, and iodized salt.</dd>
			
				<dt>kidney</dt>
				<dd>One of two organs that remove waste from the blood (as urine). The kidneys also make erythropoietin (a substance that stimulates red blood cell production) and help regulate blood pressure. The kidneys are located near the back under the lower ribs.</dd>
			
				<dt>kidney failure</dt>
				<dd>Loss of kidney function.  When kidney failure is caused by an acute (sudden and short-term) condition, such as a traumatic injury or poisoning, the kidneys may be able to recover.
